        <h1 class="title">OUR STORY</h1>
        <p class="explanation">
            In 1998, in the heart of Ethiopia's Sidamo region, a group of twenty enthusiasts united to found
            Engida Coffee. With a shared passion for Ethiopia's coffee heritage, they embarked on a mission to
            bring its flavors to the world.
            From our humble beginnings, Engida expanded across Ethiopia's highlands, forming partnerships with
            local farmers committed to quality. By 2005, we showcased our beans at Seattle's Global Coffee Expo,
            captivating international audiences.
            Despite challenges like droughts and economic shifts, Engida persevered, earning a global
            reputation. Today, in our twenty-sixth year, we stand as a symbol of Ethiopian coffee's allure,
            uniting hearts worldwide. Join us as we continue our journey, one cup at a time.
